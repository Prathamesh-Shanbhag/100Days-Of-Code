- Callback,Promises & Async/Await.

### R1D4

Potential Final Day of Javascript(Will be moving on to REACT soon! Yayy!)
All from very basics

- Callbacks,Promises and Async/Await
- AJAX,HTTP,API Requests
- Created a Random Joke Generator project using these concepts.
  Watched Eddie on Youtube Reviewing OpenSource Projects Live

### R1D5

Took it a litle easy today, was really sleep deprived, although still managed to complete two projects.
JavaScript Cocktails API Project & Random User Generator Project

- The API's used were CocktailsDB API and RandomUser API
- Made use of all AJAX Concepts like fetch, async/await.
- Also modularized the code!

COCKTAILS API PROJECT

This is one project I would recommend to others , who want to fortify their JavaScript Basics,because this project will touch on those topics from the start very well.
I really had fun making this project, Do check it out and let me know your thoughts on it!
LINK IN BIO!

### R1D6

- GETTING STARTED WITH REACT!

- Posting really late but I Finally Started with React and got introduced to create-react-app the ready-to-go template for react web-apps.
- Although I couldn't get started with much of React Concepts, I just snooped around the file structure and learnt what it contained along with the important terminal commands that will be required to build my project.
- Prepared a presentation on my final year project(which took up most of my day and React Concepts will have to wait for a bit.) & this project requires me to get started with Machine Learning using Python and also learn about OpenCV, Dlib,and TensorFlow to create the model and React for the Front-End of this Project.
- Any suggestions or resources of good quality for the project mentioned above will be greatly appreciated in the comments!
- Also Dealt with a minor bug in the cocktails api project which was preventing the fetch request , which stopped the Single Drink Page from Loading.

### R1D7(25th March)

Starting with Basic React Concepts!

- Learning about Components.
- Nested Components.
- Also learnt about JSX.
- Prepping for a 36 Hour Hackathon coming up soon!
- Couldn't do much today since I was super buzy, and will try and catch up soon.

### R1D8

Working with Components.

- Was really buzy since I am taking part in a Hackathon was on call all day and couldn't do the learning part much.
- Although the project has some advanced react concepts, I will have to learn them on the fly, I have a team-mate to help me out.
- Trying to find ways to improve my posts by using canva or so.
- Also attended a live stream by @eddiejaoude and had a really amazing conversation on GitHub and Open-Source.

### R1D9

- Another day spent all day on call and a few meetings for something coming up soon, although I did start with something cool which is creating an account on HackerRank and started with a few Practice tests on there!
- Planning to soon start with Python so it is easy for me to solve the problems on there and probably on LeetCode as well, since the text editor on HackerRank doesn't work with JavaScript very well.(Accepts Node.js JavaScript only)
- Attended the Monthly Community Call w/ @eddiejaoude and as usual it was amazing and inspiring!
  The talks included:
  Talks included :
  Github Kanban Project Board/Actions.
  Web Development/Assembly & TensorFlow for Machine Learning.
  Best Cloud Platforms to host Projects.(Digtal Ocean,AWS, etc)
  How the community is inclusive to all & overcoming the language barrier together!

### R1D10(28th March)

- Wasn't feeling very productive today, I kept delaying working and was starting to feel the burn-out.
- Got to complete only a few of the React Concepts today, and founf myself sleeping or scrolling through youtube for the rest.
- The thing that added value to my day today was the stream by @eddie on Freelancing and Tech in general, which actually made my day.
  Since he covered topics like:
  Burnout- Something that I'm starting to feel, but felt better when I heard someone address it and the way to tackle it was to take the much needed break which I'm going to cash in on soon during this challenge of 100 Days.
  How to get into Freelancing and how to always try and over-deliver to clients to improve your network, and potentially get more clients!

### R1D11(29th March)

Getting Through the RoadBlocks!

- Now stuck on a HackerRank problem that I don't think I can solve without learning any other language because using just Javascript doesn't seem to be working
- In React started learning about Inline CSS using JSX & props which work like parameters in a function, but I am yet to explore more of props.
- I will soon start learning Figma to improve the quality of my posts and provide value to people who would want to consume any content that I put out, and also I love UI/UX related content so I am ever-ready to learn stuff like that.

### R1D12

FIGMA IS AMAZING!

- As I had mentioned in my previous post, I started learning about UI/UX and also started learning Figma and its different tools.
- Figma is really versatile and User Friendly itself and as I dug deeper I found about different tools made by the community ready to use for you, which I found really amazing.
- I made this post using those tools and I can't wait to explore further and maybe share more about how I made those posts!

### R1D13

- Practiced a little more stuff using Figma, learnt a lot about certain shortcut keys, and how figma is free for individuals but paid if you work in a team.
- Got a really good workout in!
- Attended a Twitter Spaces session by @eddiejaoude on Time Management for Developers

- Leave your Feedbacks in the Comment section and let me know what you think!

### R1D14(1st april)

Today was a Rest Day

- You are allowed 1 rest day in a span of 2 weeks in the #!00DaysOfCode Challenge(You could take more depending on the situation but I would like to stick to the rules for now), which I decided to take today.
- Just attended a small DevConnect session on HackOn 2.0 with a lot of Hackers and the team consisting of Aditya,Khushi and Siddharth, and had a lot of fun!

### R1D15()

- A Day full of value.
- Got really less done in terms of completing React so to make up planning to stay up and complete it!
- Talking about value, Attended a Lot of Livestreams and TwitterSpaces!
- Livestream by @eddie and other Guild community leads (trying not to tag them all and make it spammy) - on Leveraging Communities

üö© The Slider is completely based on the useState hook and the inline onClick function in JSX.
üö© It also has a 'Surprise Me' button to provide a Random Review when clicked.
üö© The Random function is made using vanilla JS logic of using Math.random() multiplied by length of the array of reviews and that value is rounded off using Math.floor() to return a properly rounded of Random Integer Value which gives the random review.

üåä Talks/Livestreams:
üçÄ Fireside Chat with @siddharth_hacks & @iamspathan on Hackathon and Communities by @codingblocks!

üëâWhat worked for me:
I take a break first and then maybe switch to something else that is on my list of things to learn!
Which is why I have switched to learning Python! üêç ‚ù§Ô∏è
And then maybe switch back to your initial language when your brain has had some rest and cool down from seeing the same topic or language.

The Resources that I am considering to start Python on and I would recommend others who are starting out as well are:
üîπ @datacamp
üîπ @freecodecamp
üîπ @udemy
üîπ @coursera & finally
üîπ @youtube

### R1D48(5 May)

‚ú® Unproductive Day but Lesson Learnt.

üõ†Ô∏èProjects:

üö© Ran into a bug where the jobs from the API was not getting fetched & I was running into a error.
üö© Which is why when I was serving the website it showed 0 jobs found.
üö© The solution to this issue was actually really simple but it took up lot of my hours which I could've used elsewhere.

üö© The solution :
üîπThe node command to run the API wasn't working on the Powershell Terminal in-built in VS Code, so I had to first switch to system terminal for it to run.
üîπI was running into the very famous CORS error, (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) so after I did some reading up-
üëâInstall CORS using npm and import it and using : üëâvar cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors( {origin: 'URL HERE' } )) ;
this command specify which URL you would like to allow the sharing of resources to, & voila the app will start working!

üñ•Ô∏è Work:
üö©Researched about some programs I can apply to as a student.
üö© Read-up on a lot of articles related to tech & about the programs.
üö© I also looked up a few courses that I am going to start learning, not just because they're fascinating but I genuinely want to learn them to upskill myself.
üö© Started looking around in KubeCon Booths and found some really amazing products people use for Kubernetes Backup, Disaster Management, and Incident Reporting.

üåä No Talks/Livestreams Today!
üçÄCouldn't find any to be honest! And I also wasn't in the right state of mind to attend one maybe.

### R1D49(6 May)

‚ú® SO CLOSE TO HALFWAY!

üõ†Ô∏èProjects :
üö© Done with my Fullstack Javascript Application!
üö© Super happy the app works perfectly, all that's left is to improve the Front-End of the app and deploy it.
üö© I tried using Digital Ocean to deploy my application, but unfortunately, I recently discarded the credit card I was using for these purposes so maybe deploying using DO will have to wait because I don't think there's any way of proceeding without a card.

üåä Talks/Livestreams :
üçÄ DevConnect 6.0 with @sid, @khushiSharma_22, @adityaoberai1
üö© A Talk where we expected less people to turn up initially, but soon it was packed with a lot of new folks from all around the globe!
üö© The topics that we spoke on were in General on time management as a Developer or someone who's actively involved with the community.
üö© Some pros & cons of mediums of communication like Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn or plain old mailing.
üö© Some talks also related to what they don't teach you at college no matter how reputed it is.
üö© And everything else related to Hackathons!
üö© Some talks related to swag as usual, or it wouldn't have been a DevConnect session.

üö© The place where the sliding desk is present is the only desk I have got & it is in a place with lack of space, & very cramped up.

‚ú®Deep Learning + Good Vibes only! ‚ù§

In Machine Learning ‚öôÔ∏è :
üö© Completed Clustering Task & Started working on Deep Learning Perception Model which is also called as Single Layer Perception & is the basic unit of a Neural Network.
üö© It consists of Input Values, Weights, Bias & an Activation Function.
üö© Some new libraries I used were TensorFlow, & Keras.
üö© The Optimizer used in my model was sgd or Stochastic Gradient Descent & loss was in mean squared error which should reduce with each epoch.
üö© I over trained the model not realizing it should be stopped when we get a stable value.

üñ•Ô∏è Work:
üö©Submitted My Application for Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program!
üö© Trying to keep things transparent so hence sharing about this with everyone that my CFP for the lightning talk for @devrelcon Tokyo got rejected!

üö© Learnt about some really cool stuff related to Deep Learning like Image Classification, Transfer Learning, & ready to use models available from Cloud Services since it is very difficult to determine perfect parameters by ourselves.

üö© My Journey in MLDLS was absolutely phenomenal, I feel like I actually started from the basics, & moved onto complex topics that I can now implement by myself!
üö© The Assignments were such an integral part, If it was just sessions I probably wouldn't have tried to implement it by myself.
üö© Although the Journey was amazing, All Good things must come to an end & so we had the closing ceremony, & got our certificates!
üö© My only Ray of hope to stay connected & enjoy this journey for a little longer is the Capstone Project! ‚ù§(Super Excited!)

‚ú®A Day Well Spent!

üö©I actually spent most of the time writing out my previous posts, & most importantly -
üö© I helped out few friends of mine get started with Git & Github, helped them host their very first website using Vercel & Firebase both because they were interested in learning both the technologies.
üö© I also gave them a quick intro on What is React?, How does it work, terms like Components, & Getting Started using Create-React-App!
üö© I also told them about the Github Student Developer Pack, which they were unaware of until now!
üö© The feeling of helping someone get started with something that you're equally passionate about is something that can't be matched, which is one of the many reasons why communities are amazing! ‚ù§ (Think of it as your friends watching a show with the same interest & enthusiasm as you, & that show was recommended by you from one of your favourites!)

üåä Talks/Livestreams :
