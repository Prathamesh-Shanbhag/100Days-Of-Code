### R1D1

Learnt about Functions/ES6 Syntax
IFFE,Hoisting,Closure, Usage of Var Let Const,Function/Block Scope,Template Strings,String Interpolation,Tagged Template Literals(Temp Literals + Functions)

### R1D2

Started Learning Docker, Attended A Webinar on Machine Learning.
Helped a friend to start learning about Git & GitHub(made their very first repo!), and also Website Hosting via FireBase.
Under JavaScript I learnt about :

- 'This' Keyword in ES6 & Normal Functions
- Default Parameters in Functions
- Destructuring Arrays
- Swapping Variables
- Destructuring Objects by itself & using Functions.
- New String Methods introduced in ES6 Javascript
- For of Loop

### R1D3

Decided to Complete with ES6 major concepts today and I am almost done with JavaScript.
Topics I Covered:

- Spread Operator
- Rest Operator
- ES6 Array Methods
- Modularizing of Code as done in React
- Callback,Promises & Async/Await.

### R1D4

Potential Final Day of Javascript(Will be moving on to REACT soon! Yayy!)
All from very basics

- Callbacks,Promises and Async/Await
- AJAX,HTTP,API Requests
- Created a Random Joke Generator project using these concepts.
  Watched Eddie on Youtube Reviewing OpenSource Projects Live
- All my knowledge on Opensource has been through Eddie and the EddieHub Community.
- Learnt a lot about how to make a good open source project some points include
- Include Version Releases
- Include GitHub Actions
- Have a well documented readme file
- Create labels for issues and create issues too!
- Include Important Project links in respective places.

### R1D5

Took it a litle easy today, was really sleep deprived, although still managed to complete two projects.
JavaScript Cocktails API Project & Random User Generator Project

- The API's used were CocktailsDB API and RandomUser API
- Made use of all AJAX Concepts like fetch, async/await.
- Also modularized the code!

COCKTAILS API PROJECT

This is one project I would recommend to others , who want to fortify their JavaScript Basics,because this project will touch on those topics from the start very well.
I really had fun making this project, Do check it out and let me know your thoughts on it!
LINK IN BIO!

### R1D6

- GETTING STARTED WITH REACT!

- Posting really late but I Finally Started with React and got introduced to create-react-app the ready-to-go template for react web-apps.
- Although I couldn't get started with much of React Concepts, I just snooped around the file structure and learnt what it contained along with the important terminal commands that will be required to build my project.
- Prepared a presentation on my final year project(which took up most of my day and React Concepts will have to wait for a bit.) & this project requires me to get started with Machine Learning using Python and also learn about OpenCV, Dlib,and TensorFlow to create the model and React for the Front-End of this Project.
- Any suggestions or resources of good quality for the project mentioned above will be greatly appreciated in the comments!
- Also Dealt with a minor bug in the cocktails api project which was preventing the fetch request , which stopped the Single Drink Page from Loading.

### R1D7(25th March)

Starting with Basic React Concepts!

- Learning about Components.
- Nested Components.
- Also learnt about JSX.
- Prepping for a 36 Hour Hackathon coming up soon!
- Couldn't do much today since I was super buzy, and will try and catch up soon.
