- Made use of all AJAX Concepts like fetch, async/await.
- Also modularized the code!

COCKTAILS API PROJECT

This is one project I would recommend to others , who want to fortify their JavaScript Basics,because this project will touch on those topics from the start very well.
I really had fun making this project, Do check it out and let me know your thoughts on it!
LINK IN BIO!

### R1D6

- GETTING STARTED WITH REACT!

- Posting really late but I Finally Started with React and got introduced to create-react-app the ready-to-go template for react web-apps.
- Although I couldn't get started with much of React Concepts, I just snooped around the file structure and learnt what it contained along with the important terminal commands that will be required to build my project.
- Prepared a presentation on my final year project(which took up most of my day and React Concepts will have to wait for a bit.) & this project requires me to get started with Machine Learning using Python and also learn about OpenCV, Dlib,and TensorFlow to create the model and React for the Front-End of this Project.
- Any suggestions or resources of good quality for the project mentioned above will be greatly appreciated in the comments!
- Also Dealt with a minor bug in the cocktails api project which was preventing the fetch request , which stopped the Single Drink Page from Loading.

### R1D7(25th March)

Starting with Basic React Concepts!

- Learning about Components.
- Nested Components.
- Also learnt about JSX.
- Prepping for a 36 Hour Hackathon coming up soon!
- Couldn't do much today since I was super buzy, and will try and catch up soon.

### R1D8

Working with Components.

- Was really buzy since I am taking part in a Hackathon was on call all day and couldn't do the learning part much.
- Although the project has some advanced react concepts, I will have to learn them on the fly, I have a team-mate to help me out.
- Trying to find ways to improve my posts by using canva or so.
- Also attended a live stream by @eddiejaoude and had a really amazing conversation on GitHub and Open-Source.

### R1D9

- Another day spent all day on call and a few meetings for something coming up soon, although I did start with something cool which is creating an account on HackerRank and started with a few Practice tests on there!
- Planning to soon start with Python so it is easy for me to solve the problems on there and probably on LeetCode as well, since the text editor on HackerRank doesn't work with JavaScript very well.(Accepts Node.js JavaScript only)
- Attended the Monthly Community Call w/ @eddiejaoude and as usual it was amazing and inspiring!
  The talks included:
  Talks included :
  Github Kanban Project Board/Actions.
  Web Development/Assembly & TensorFlow for Machine Learning.
  Best Cloud Platforms to host Projects.(Digtal Ocean,AWS, etc)
  How the community is inclusive to all & overcoming the language barrier together!

### R1D10(28th March)

- Wasn't feeling very productive today, I kept delaying working and was starting to feel the burn-out.
- Got to complete only a few of the React Concepts today, and founf myself sleeping or scrolling through youtube for the rest.
- The thing that added value to my day today was the stream by @eddie on Freelancing and Tech in general, which actually made my day.
  Since he covered topics like:
  Burnout- Something that I'm starting to feel, but felt better when I heard someone address it and the way to tackle it was to take the much needed break which I'm going to cash in on soon during this challenge of 100 Days.
  How to get into Freelancing and how to always try and over-deliver to clients to improve your network, and potentially get more clients!

### R1D11(29th March)

Getting Through the RoadBlocks!

- Now stuck on a HackerRank problem that I don't think I can solve without learning any other language because using just Javascript doesn't seem to be working
- In React started learning about Inline CSS using JSX & props which work like parameters in a function, but I am yet to explore more of props.
- I will soon start learning Figma to improve the quality of my posts and provide value to people who would want to consume any content that I put out, and also I love UI/UX related content so I am ever-ready to learn stuff like that.

### R1D12

FIGMA IS AMAZING!

- As I had mentioned in my previous post, I started learning about UI/UX and also started learning Figma and its different tools.
- Figma is really versatile and User Friendly itself and as I dug deeper I found about different tools made by the community ready to use for you, which I found really amazing.
- I made this post using those tools and I can't wait to explore further and maybe share more about how I made those posts!

### R1D13

- Practiced a little more stuff using Figma, learnt a lot about certain shortcut keys, and how figma is free for individuals but paid if you work in a team.
- Got a really good workout in!
- Attended a Twitter Spaces session by @eddiejaoude on Time Management for Developers

- Leave your Feedbacks in the Comment section and let me know what you think!

### R1D14(1st april)

- Just attended a small DevConnect session on HackOn 2.0 with a lot of Hackers and the team consisting of Aditya,Khushi and Siddharth, and had a lot of fun!

### R1D15()

- A Day full of value.
- Got really less done in terms of completing React so to make up planning to stay up and complete it!
- Talking about value, Attended a Lot of Livestreams and TwitterSpaces!

In React ⚛️:
🚩 Worked & Completed a Menu Project that gets data from the API.
🚩 The Project has buttons to filter the data to view only categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner and an All Foods option as well.
🚩 The Data from the API is stored in an array and then using the filter method, a new array with all items that match the category of the selected option is returned.
🚩 The Categories are also dynamic, meaning if a new food with a new category gets added in the data from the API, then the button to filter that data gets automatically rendered as well.

🚩 The Slider is completely based on the useState hook and the inline onClick function in JSX.
🚩 It also has a 'Surprise Me' button to provide a Random Review when clicked.
🚩 The Random function is made using vanilla JS logic of using Math.random() multiplied by length of the array of reviews and that value is rounded off using Math.floor() to return a properly rounded of Random Integer Value which gives the random review.

🌊 Talks/Livestreams:
🍀 Fireside Chat with @siddharth_hacks & @iamspathan on Hackathon and Communities by @codingblocks!

🕔 I have been staying up late almost daily, up until 5am constantly doing something be it coding or completing the courses, looking for new opportunities!

😪 Which has ultimately led me to become a little sleep deprived, hence decided to take a Break today & tomorrow and will be back in full swing thereafter!
🌟 This is actually going to be the simple rule I will follow if I think things are getting overwhelming!

Regardless I still couldn't miss out on-

### R1D48(5 May)

✨ Unproductive Day but Lesson Learnt.

🛠️Projects:

🚩 Ran into a bug where the jobs from the API was not getting fetched & I was running into a error.
🚩 Which is why when I was serving the website it showed 0 jobs found.
🚩 The solution to this issue was actually really simple but it took up lot of my hours which I could've used elsewhere.

🚩 The solution :
🔹The node command to run the API wasn't working on the Powershell Terminal in-built in VS Code, so I had to first switch to system terminal for it to run.
🔹I was running into the very famous CORS error, (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) so after I did some reading up-
👉Install CORS using npm and import it and using : 👉var cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors( {origin: 'URL HERE' } )) ;
this command specify which URL you would like to allow the sharing of resources to, & voila the app will start working!

🖥️ Work:
🚩Researched about some programs I can apply to as a student.
🚩 Read-up on a lot of articles related to tech & about the programs.
🚩 I also looked up a few courses that I am going to start learning, not just because they're fascinating but I genuinely want to learn them to upskill myself.
🚩 Started looking around in KubeCon Booths and found some really amazing products people use for Kubernetes Backup, Disaster Management, and Incident Reporting.

### R1D49(6 May)

✨ SO CLOSE TO HALFWAY!

🛠️Projects :
🚩 Done with my Fullstack Javascript Application!
🚩 Super happy the app works perfectly, all that's left is to improve the Front-End of the app and deploy it.
🚩 I tried using Digital Ocean to deploy my application, but unfortunately, I recently discarded the credit card I was using for these purposes so maybe deploying using DO will have to wait because I don't think there's any way of proceeding without a card.

🌊 Talks/Livestreams :
🍀 DevConnect 6.0 with @sid, @khushiSharma_22, @adityaoberai1
🚩 A Talk where we expected less people to turn up initially, but soon it was packed with a lot of new folks from all around the globe!

🔹What to do when Fatigue sets in?
🚩 It's okay to not be productive all the time, take a Break overall, or from social media if necessary.
Trying to stay productive is a vicious cycle which may end up leading you a darker path like Burnout or extreme digital strain.

🍀Sawo Vibe Check Ep-3: Communities Led Startup with @cherish, @ninad @prabhat @kitty
🚩 How Communities are shaping the startup ecosystem!
🚩 Company with communities always have a headstart.
🚩 In the presence of a community led startup it's difficult to break the network and leadership connections.
🚩 Shift of Companies from Product-led startups to Communities-led startup.
🚩 Somebody referred to by a community member is more likely to stay, or becomes a permanent user for your product.
🚩 Ways to keep your community engaged.
🚩 Keep the core values of your product intact, & don't clutter it, instead work on scaling & optimizing.
🚩Community led startup isn't something that is a checkbox on the marketing checklist, but it should be done with a clear vision, to properly make it a success.
🚩 Mindset is really important when forming a community.
🚩 Every company has different visions & needs so communities are not recommended for every company.
🚩 Start with a small focus group & then try and scale it into a community.
🚩 Don't stick to just one form of marketing like just creating content only.
🚩 Statistical Predictions are not always accurate so don't just rely on it.
🚩 You should value the time of investors & don't make promises like making the world a better place to live in, which might cause the investors to turn off & make you lose their attention.
🚩 Fojnders shouldn't get discouraged when some other potential startups get a large funding.
🚩 Also don't let the funding you might get distract you, & lose your vision and cool.

🚩 As a Program Manager, what things one can keep in mind before/while working on creating the program for students in communities?
Question by @siddharth_hacks & I actually loved this answer because from what I heard GitHub is every students dream!
🔹The simple answer is to put yourself in the shoes of the Student, & understand what problems the students face, like monetary or having exams during the application period & overall not add on to those issues by creating those features in a program.

🚩 The story of how GCE came into being & that story was mind-blowing.
🚩 I really liked the fact that Joe mentioned that they really made the program keeping in mind the status of students.

🚩 The GitHub marketing tactic which is not forced marketing but giving students, learners & the Github Campus Experts an option to voluntarily share about GitHub if you want to, which I think speaks volumes about the company.
🚩 How GitHub Education aims to help people become software engineers because then when you start encountering large codebases & work in teams, Git & GitHub become necessary!
🚩 Reverse Engineering the usage of Git & Github by making people encounter a problem that will require them to use Git & Github. (🤯Me Right now)
Best Example = Hackathons!

🚩 Small Discussion on Discord V/S Slack, & Joe's vision for Discord in 2018 :P
🚩 Features of the GCE & the Collaborative efforts of the Community of the GCE!

🚩 Advice to anyone wanting to become a DevRel?
